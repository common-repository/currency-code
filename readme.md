### Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/currency-code` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

Shortcodes work out-of-the-box and widgets require adding to your sidebar before being available.

### FAQ / Info

##### Shortcode

To use the shortcode, simply use something like the default value below in your content:

[currency from="GBP" to="USD" round="2"]

You can replace the currency values with any of the supported currencies, which are listed below.

The round attribute controls to how many decimal places the figure display will round to.

The sample output for this is:

1 GBP = 1.33 USD

##### Widget

To use the widget go to Appearance -> Widgets and drag the Currency Converter widget into one of your sidebars.

The sample output of the widget is the same as the shortcode:

1 GBP = 1.33 USD

To see how the widget works code-wise check out the JSFiddle the widget is built from (https://jsfiddle.net/stevenkellow/x3hdtja6/2/)
